# UMD-shuttle-nextbus-data-collection

In this repository, I implement scripts to collect data of University of Maryland shuttles (shuttle-UM) from Nextbus, including: list of routes and schedule information for all routes. Data are saved in 2 json files (route_config_data.json and bus_schedule_data.json). 

The document below provides information about the URLs that can be used and examples of the XML that is returned.
